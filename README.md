# Mrowr Purr's Reverse Engineering Journey

As I learn to reverse engineer video games, I am putting the source code for everything that I learn here.

### Learning Goals

I one day hope to have a variety of examples demonstrating:

- Some examples of simple x86 and x64 assembly programs
- Program memory read/write via external executables
- Program memory read/write via internally injected libraries
  - Libraries / Tools for .dll injection (using different patterns)
- Detours / Trampolines
- Cheat Engine cheat tables for various games
- Minimal modding frameworks for various games in various languages
  - C++
  - Rust
- Embedded virtual machines with library with bindings to host process memory alteration (with REPL)
  - Lua
  - JavaScript
  - Python
- And more!

I'm just getting started learning, so we'll see!
